# Qapla

## Qapla 60 key keyboard

Qapla is a 60 key keyboard with Choc switches inspired by Lilly58 and Sofle. Columns have splay and stagger based on my cardboard mocks.

For designing the layout it uses

* [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) to define layout, generate PCB and case.
* [Ceoloide Footprints](https://github.com/achamian/ergogen-footprints/tree/diode_via_connections) to add footprints (It is a fork which adds via pads for diodes).
* Routing is done in KiCad.
